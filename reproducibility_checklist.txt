\label{app:repro_checklist}
A complete reproduction requires:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dataset source and split definition (train/dev/test).
  \item Corpus sampling procedure and corpus size used for indexing.
  \item Chunking and tokenization settings.
  \item Embedding model and vector-index configuration.
  \item ABAC policy predicates and required metadata fields.
  \item Security workload templates, attack-class definitions, and attacker/victim selection procedure.
  \item Leakage detectors and thresholds (L1/L2/L3 and auxiliary exposure flags).
  \item Scripts that regenerate paper tables and figures from CSV artifacts.
\end{itemize}
